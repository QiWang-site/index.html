I am currently a Postdoc at Department of Applied Mathematics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), working with Prof. Defeng Sun (SIAM Fellow) (https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/people/academic-staff/prof-sun-defeng/). I received my PhD degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Tsinghua University in 2024, advised by Prof. Wenchuan Wu (IEEE Fellow) (https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/faculties/wuwench.htm).

My research is primarily focused on efficient distributed optimization algorithms and their applications in coordinated optimization for hierarchical electrical power grids with integration of renewable generation. In this regard, I have conducted multiple studies to address the large-scale, non-convex, mixed-integer, spatio-temporal coupling optimization problems considering imperfect communication. These achievements also led to my nomination as a finalist (Top 1%) in the Ph.D. Dissertation Challenge of IEEE I&CPS Asia 2023 (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/mvwTmfKwyclKz9_x-txZdg).
